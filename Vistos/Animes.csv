Putting aside his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels compelled to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers.",tv

When it became co-ed, the girls, out of fear, asked to be permitted to bring weapons to school. When that was enforced, a five-member vigilante corps-like organization called the ""Supreme Five Swords"" was also formed.

Nomura Fudou was sent to this school after being part of a huge brawl. What will he do when the only options he has after enrolling are being expelled from that school or being corrected the way the rest of the male students there were...by being forced to dress and act like a girl!

It's a savage sport where the strongest survive, and anyone willing to test their mettle can step into the ring. There is, however, a minimum size requirement to be a pro sumo wrestler, and young Hinomaru Ushio, incredibly talented and hardworking though he may be, does not meet that requirement. This small boy has big dreams of reaching the highest class of sumo, Hinoshita Kaisan. The only way he could possibly go pro is if he becomes the High School Yokozuna, a title given to the strongest wrestler in high school tournaments. Ushio is under a lot of pressure, as well as a time limit. If he can't show off his skills in the high school tournaments, he may lose his chance to go pro permanently, and the odds are stacked against him. Instead of enrolling in Ishigami High, the best school for sumo in Japan, he enrolls in Odachi High and must build a sumo club from the ground up with the one devout member Shinya Ozeki. Odachi High is the true underdog of the sumo world, but Ushio has to push forward with all his strength if he is going to make it professionally.",tv

Kagami is a basketball prodigy hailing from America, while Kuroko's less-than-average physique conceals the fact that he was part of Teikou Middle School's famous ""Generation of Miracles"" Basketball Team. After training to become a more cohesive team, Seirin faces a major setback during the Interhigh championship when it faces off against Touou Academy—the new home of Kuroko's former teammate Daiki Aomine. Jaded by the lack of competition, Aomine single-handedly overwhelms Kagami and Kuroko's newfound ""light and shadow"" partnership, claiming that they will never be able to surpass him or his ""light."" Now that the Winter Cup has rolled around, the reignited Seirin is out for vengeance against Touou. Although the team has been training relentlessly, it may not be enough to take down their rival, as Aomine carefully begins to see through Kuroko and Kagami's tricks.",movie

Taken out in a single round, Junk Dog is left with a challenge: ""If you're serious about fighting me again, then fight your way up to me and my ring."" Filled with overwhelming excitement and backed by the criminal syndicate responsible for his thrown matches, Junk Dog enters Megalonia: a world-spanning tournament that will decide the strongest Megalo Boxer of them all.
